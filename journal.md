Date 9/3/2025 - Subject:I fixed my problems. Today, I fixed the issues that I was having with github and realized I should probably pay attention 
during class and solve the problem afterwards instead of trying to solve the problem during class. I didn't get behind because of it. It just made 
me look like an idiot.
