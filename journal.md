Date 9/3/2025 - Subject:I fixed my problems. Today, I fixed the issues that I was having with github and realized I should probably pay attention 
during class and solve the problem afterwards instead of trying to solve the problem during class. I didn't get behind because of it. It just made 
me look like an idiot.

My precious laptop Vicky was tragically fried a few days ago and I decided to get an upgraded computer.
Now I code on Lenny and get to see the terminal in high resolution and a beautiful OLED screen, much to
my bank account's dismay. Now I am trying to fix all of my ssh things with github so I can continue passing
off assignments in classes. Wish me luck. I just now realized that I was forgetting to push my journal entries
off of my old laptop. Daggum!!!

10/2/2025 - Subject: I am getting kicked over and over again in calculus and CS-2810. CS-2810 is getting insanly
hard by this point in the semester. I've never held such a bad grade in a class while actively trying to learn and
fix it. Calculus is giving much less trouble but the homework is getting exponentially harder and I'm just lucky I
have ChatGPT to reteach me the processes of calculus. Without AI, I would not be able to get by and think I should
get rid of this dependancy. In CS-2810, next week, we will be moving up to learning C. I look forward to this as I
have heard it has structure and looks way easier to read and write. Wish me luck!
