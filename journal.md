Date 9/3/2025 - Subject:I fixed my problems. Today, I fixed the issues that I was having with github and realized I should probably pay attention 
during class and solve the problem afterwards instead of trying to solve the problem during class. I didn't get behind because of it. It just made 
me look like an idiot.


9/26/2025 Topic: It turns out that putting in an SSD barely wrong doesn't immediately cook your computer.
My precious laptop Vicky was tragically fried a few days ago and I decided to get an upgraded computer.
Now I code on Lenny and get to see the terminal in high resolution and a beautiful OLED screen, much to
my bank account's dismay. Now I am trying to fix all of my ssh things with github so I can continue passing
off assignments in classes. Wish me luck. I just now realized that I was forgetting to push my journal entries
off of my old laptop. Daggum!!!

10/2/2025 - Subject: I am getting kicked over and over again in calculus and CS-2810. CS-2810 is getting insanly
hard by this point in the semester. I've never held such a bad grade in a class while actively trying to learn and
fix it. Calculus is giving much less trouble but the homework is getting exponentially harder and I'm just lucky I
have ChatGPT to reteach me the processes of calculus. Without AI, I would not be able to get by and think I should
get rid of this dependancy. In CS-2810, next week, we will be moving up to learning C. I look forward to this as I
have heard it has structure and looks way easier to read and write. Wish me luck!



10/27/2025 - Subject: I haven't filled this out in the past few weeks unfortunately. I am getting to the point in the
semester where I always experience a little bit of burn out and start losing motivation. I am hoping over thanksgiving
break, I can regain some of that motivation I had towards the beginning of the semester. I have learned a lot in this
class and in all of my other classes. Although my motivation and enthusiasm has faded a bit, I look forward to learning
more about coding and how I can become a better computer scientist.



11/3/2025 - Subject: I need to learn how to not get so distracted. I have had a lot of things distracting me from school.
Work stresses, my social life, lots of stress from friends moving away and leaving on missions, etc. I need to learn
how to maintain my stress and get my schoolwork done. I have always had issues with getting things in on time and now
it is worse than ever. Every once in a while, I do get a boost of motivation and during those time periods is when
I get all of my stuff done. This semester, I have had a lot of pressure to make the most of my time with my friends as
they are all server church missions as well as making new friends so I am not alone. I gotta LOCK IN!!!



11/12/2025 - Subject: The end of the semester is finally coming! Unrelated to school, I am getting together with some
coworkers today and we are having an oil changing party. We are also having a barbecue to further increase the masculinity.
Jokes aside, I am learning an important skill and getting a ton of entertainment from it. School could be going a bit better,
calculus has stopped giving me such a hard time but I have a lot of things to study for as the end of the semester approaches. 

11/17/2025 - Subject: I have no clue why I'm getting burned out. I've been burnt out the past little bit and my grades
are showing it. I never know how to manage burnout but it always come towards the end of the semester and I find a way
to pass all of my classes anyways. It is especially hard with all of life's distractions, I need to get better at setting
goals for myself and focusing on them. I think goal setting will be my key to productivity and I hope it helps.
