Date 9/3/2025 - Subject:I fixed my problems. Today, I fixed the issues that I was having with github and realized I should probably pay attention 
during class and solve the problem afterwards instead of trying to solve the problem during class. I didn't get behind because of it. It just made 
me look like an idiot.

My precious laptop Vicky was tragically fried a few days ago and I decided to get an upgraded computer.
Now I code on Lenny and get to see the terminal in high resolution and a beautiful OLED screen, much to
my bank account's dismay. Now I am trying to fix all of my ssh things with github so I can continue passing
off assignments in classes. Wish me luck. I just now realized that I was forgetting to push my journal entries
off of my old laptop. Daggum!!!
